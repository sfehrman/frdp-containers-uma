# frdp-containers-uma

ForgeRock Demonstration Platform (FRDP) : **Containers UMA** : Is a repository that provides a *Ready-2-Run* environment for testing the User-Managed Access (UMA) Reference Implementation.  The project requires [`docker` and `docker-compose`](http://docs.docker.com) technologies.  The [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) was used to develop this project.

This GitHub repository leverages containers to easily *stand-up* a User-Managed Access (UMA) test environment. The following GitHub repositories are used:

- [frdp-framework](https://github.com/ForgeRock/frdp-framework)
- [frdp-dao-mongo](https://github.com/ForgeRock/frdp-dao-mongo)
- [frdp-content-server](https://github.com/ForgeRock/frdp-content-server)
- [frdp-dao-rest](https://github.com/ForgeRock/frdp-dao-rest)
- [frdp-uma-resource-server](https://github.com/ForgeRock/frdp-uma-resource-server)

The GitHub repositories, [ForgeRock Access Manager](https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management), and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) are used to create [Docker](http://docs.docker.com) images that are managed by Docker Compose.  The provided Postman collections and *step-by-step* documentation provide a easy way to test UMA use cases.

git clone https://github.com/ForgeRock/frdp-containers-uma.git
```

## ForgeRock Access Manager / Amster

This project uses the ForgeRock Access Manager 7.0.1 which provides User-Manager Access (UMA) Authorization Server functionality. The ForgeRock Amster utility is used to automate the configuration of Access Manager.  Access Manager and Amster can be download from the ForgeRock [backstage](https://backstage.forgerock.com/downloads/browse/am/latest) web site.  

**NOTICE:** You need an account to access the ForgeRock backstage resources.

1. Download the **Access Manager** zip file and save it to a temporary location.
1. From the temporary Access Manager location, expanded zip file 
1. From the temporary Access Manager location ...\
Copy the `openam/AM-7.0.1.war` file to: \
`containers/auth-server/docker/build/resources/am.war`
1. Download the **Amster** zip file and save it to a temporary location.
1. Copy the `Amster-7.0.1.zip` file to: \

# Setup

## hostnames

You must add the following aliases to the `/etc/hosts` file for `localhost`
- `as.example.com`
- `rs.example.com`

### For MacOS

```bash
sudo vi /etc/hosts
```
 - **BEFORE**: \
`127.0.0.1       localhost`
- **AFTER**: \
`127.0.0.1       localhost as.example.com rs.example.com`

## Notice

This project will use a number of ports on your local system.  See the table below for which *localhost* ports are used.  The `docker-compose.yml` file and individual `Dockerfile` files can be modified to use different *localhost* ports.

# Run

Use the `docker-compose` command build and run the Docker containers:

```bash
$ cd frdp-containers-uma
$ docker-compose up --build
```

# Verify

## Docker

After the *build* process is complete, check that the containers are running.  Open another terminal and run `docker ps`:

```bash
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                      NAMES

```
## Authorization Server

Log into the Authorization Server as the two test users. Open a web browser and access ... `http://as.example.com:8080/am`

| User | Password | First name | Last name | UMA operations |
| ---- | -------- | ---------- | --------- | -------------- |
| `dcrane` | `Uma-1234` | Danny | Crane | Resource Owner |
| `bjensen` | `Uma-1234` | Barb | Jensen | Requesting Party |

- From the top toolbar
- Select **SHARES** drop down menu
- Select **RESOURCES** menu item
- From Left Menu ...\
**My Resource** displays the user's registered UMA resources \
**Shared with Me** displays resource's the user can access

**Note:** You will not see any UMA resources until they are registered and have a policy.

# Testing

To test the UMA containers environment, [**postman**](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) collections have been provided. 

See the [Postman folder](/postman) ... which contains an environment file, collection files and test procedures.
